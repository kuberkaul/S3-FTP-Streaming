S3-FTP-Streaming
================
This project basically is a hack on top of amazon S3 service. It uses an EC2 instance and creates a FTP server in the machine and mounts the S3 inside the instance again. Using cloud front for streaming and FTP server to support FTP request it uses the S3 to stream data to clients. We also note here that S3 is native to http so that is already covered.
