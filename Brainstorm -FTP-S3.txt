s3-FTP-Solution (https://github.com/kuberkaul/S3-FTP-Streaming)


Amazon S3 doesn't expose an FTP interface for now. However there are number of commercial s3-rd party solutions that I found :

1. You can use Amazon EC2 + TntDrive to set up an FTP server that uses S3 as a storage backend.

2. You may take a look at SMEStorage, afaik they provide an s3-to-ftp solution.

3. Create an ec2 instance and load FTP server and S3 programmatically into it.

But FTP protocol is not supported natively by Amazon S3.
